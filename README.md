## Project Information

Smart Fridge introduces a well-built camera surveillance system, powered by computer vision, made for integration within refrigerators. This solution empowers users with the capability to remotely monitor the contents of their refrigerator. The system comes with a dedicated mobile application where users can not only visually inspect their inventory in real-time but also interact and manage their grocery listings, inventory duration tracking, meal planning, and other refrigeration settings with ease and precision. This convergence of technology aims to elevate the standards of household management by merging technology to everyday lives.
